and so now if we observe and 
now 
n& n-1 has same bit as n except the right most set bit. example
 n=8= 1000
 n-1= 7= 0111
 1000&0111 =0000 which is similar to n as only right most bit differ..
 we can conclude all number which is  power of 2 have only one set bit 
 so if it is and with n-1 will give 0. */
