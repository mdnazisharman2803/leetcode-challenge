##About the Repository
The repository holds solutions of Leetcode challenges. The key intake of this repository is "**Data Structures and Algorithms**"

##What are Data Structures and Algorithms?
*Data structures* are programmatic way to store and organize data. It is required in order for data to be used efficiently. It is generally referred to as a data organization, management and storage format for efficient access to data./
*Algorithms* are defined as a finite sequence of instructions or a set of rules to be followed in order to perform a computation./
*(In layman's terms, the instructions to perform any arithmetic operation, long division, or even to bake a cake are algorithms)*/
So, all in all, an algorithm is a replicable set of steps to accomplish a specific goal.

##Why to learn DSA?
The term **DSA** has been a buzz around in the industry. You must be wondering their role in your tech journey./
Well, here are a few reasons to begin with:

-While Data structures provide an efficient way to store and organize data, following the algorithms provides more efficient use of data.
-To solve some Real-World Complex Problems
-To optimise your code *(Very important while dealing with large software!)*
-To save the two most valuable resources of a computer -
--Time
--Memory
-To obtain a scalable solution/
and many more reasons in line

##A Few Resources to Learn DSA
Here are a few resources to get started with your DSA Journey-
-[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
-[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
-[Learn x in y minutes] (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/dynamic-programming/)
-[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/selflearning?itm_medium=navmenu&itm_campaign=learncp)

*You can also look out for a few youtube channels to help you with!*/

At the end, remember that- **Practice is the key**/
As long as you practice implementation along with your learning, your DSA Journey will sail smoothly!
